Version 1.5.14 (October 14th 2022)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.4 patch.
* Added hooligan captains.
	* Armed with a revolver and equipped with a full set of flak armour.
	* Not as common as other hooligans.
* Added a scenario which lets you play as a group of hooligans.
	* Start with 6 pawns, 100 silver, 6 knives, 60 survival meals, and 100 of each main drug.
	* Start with drug production research, as well as the research to unlock production of other drugs.
	* Starting pawns have a 100% chance of having the chemical fascination trait.
	* Starting pawns will also be addicted to something.
	* Starting pawns will be wearing nothing but a pair of pants.
	* Permanently hostile to all other factions except the NPC hooligans (and the brony faction if My Little RimPony is enabled; they're willing to give you a chance, but you can still attack them if you want).
* Added a trader who is basically a drug dealer.
* Ideology: Added a preset ideology you can select.
	* Uses the Supremacist, Raider and High Life memes.
* NPC faction Hooligans can now have the 'Body purist' trait.
* NPC faction Hooligans can no longer have traits related to drug desire.
	* This is mostly so they can't be teetotallers any more.
	* It also means they can't have chemical fascination/interest either.
	* I wasn't sure if it was possible to restrict it to just teetotaller.
* Changed the NPC faction description from 'What are you looking at?' to something more resembling a proper description.
* Hooligan veterans are now equipped with flak vests.
* Hooligans can no longer be female.
* Ideology: The NPC hooligan faction now uses the 'High Life' meme by default.

Version 1.1.7 (March 3rd 2022)

* The hooligans have finally realised that they're supposed to hate your guts, and should no longer send you offers to attend peace talks.
* Hooligan pawns can now have tribal backgrounds.
* Hooligan pawns can now have the 'Pyromaniac' trait.
* Hooligan pawns can no longer have the 'Kind' trait.
* Fixed error related to invalid TraitDef if My Little RimPony is not enabled.
* Tidied up the Patches folder by putting files into their relevant folders.

Version 1.1.2 (January 20th 2022)

* Added hooligan veterans.
	* Armed with either a knife, an axe or molotov cocktails, making them slightly more dangerous than their beer and wood wielding friends.
